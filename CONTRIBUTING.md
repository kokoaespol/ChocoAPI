new feature, bug fix, etc. to be included in our project, this would help to our team
to easily report changes or approve your pull request.

Every pull request must have the next template:

```text
Title: A new great feature!!!

Description:

```

The **Title** need to show a summary or a name for the new change/fix/feature, this should not
be too long.

The **Description** you can show your reasons why/how/what are you making this pull request, if
possible show an example of the use case to sustain your change and get the approval.
